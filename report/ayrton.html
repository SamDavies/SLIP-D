                <p>In this report I will discuss my contributions to
                    the <em>SmartLock</em> project, discussing the motivation for
                    design choices, technical implementation details and
                    critical evaluation of the work produced.</p>

                <p>My contribution to the project can be summarised as
                    the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Produced a web application management

                        allow development of the software components

                    <li>Improved the API logic<sup><a
                                                       href="#gh-lock-logic">[2]</a></sup> for
                        communicating with the <em>SmartLock</em>

                    <li>Contributed endpoints<sup><a

                        API to provide data required by the web
                        application.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <subsection class="col-md-12">
                    
                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    
                    <p>The task for this course was to design and
                        build an Internet of Things (IoT) device and
                        a suite of applications to interface with it.</p>

                    <p>We met up in the first week of the semester to
                        share our ideas and take the most promising ones
                        to the next stage. Some of those ideas included:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A <strong>dance mat</strong> which
                            measures the level of movement, to allow
                            nightclub DJs to analyse the crowd's
                            reactions to the music being played and
                            use this information to improve their
                            playlist.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A <strong>board game</strong> which
                            detects game pieces and shares its state
                            with an API, allowing two players to play
                            against each other remotely (either via
                            another board, or an app we would
                            develop), or against an AI.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A <strong>door lock</strong> which can be
                            opened remotely via the internet, allowing
                            the owner to share access with friends or
                            housemates.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The group decided that the door lock idea had
                        the most potential. The project was small
                        enough in scope to allow us to focus on
                        producing a quality product, but large enough
                        to provide each team member with a substantial
                        amount of interesting work.</p>

                    <p>I had a very personal stake in this idea;
                        myself and my flatmate have thought about
                        implementing it before (after one too many
                        accidental lock-outs), but we have never had
                        the time to explore it until now.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Analysis</h2>
                    
                    <p>To create the door lock we would need an
                        <strong>integrated system</strong> to handle
                        communication between the device and the user. We
                        also wanted to provide <strong>iOS</strong>,
                        <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>web</strong>
                        applications to allow users to access the lock
                        wherever they are, using whatever device they have
                        available.</p>

                    <p>I was tasked with development of the web
                        application, which was intended to be an
                        <strong>administrative interface</strong> where a
                        user could control their devices and who has
                        access to them. We later extended this
                        functionality to the mobile applications,
                        providing consistency across all devices.</p>

                    <p>We felt it was important that the application use
                        <strong>responsive design</strong> techniques to
                        provide access to users on operating systems other
                        than iOS and Android (such as Windows Phones and
                        Blackberry devices).</p>

                    <p>The application would need to provide the
                        following core functionality:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide a means to <strong>register devices</strong> to a user</li>
                        <li>Allow users to <strong>operate</strong> their registered devices remotely</li>
                        <li>Display the <strong>status</strong> of their registered devices at all times</li>
                        <li>Provide <strong>shared access controls</strong></li>
                        <li>Allow <strong>secure communication</strong> between the user and their device</li>
                        <li>Display correctly across a <strong>range of mobile and desktop platforms</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </subsection>
                
            </section>

                <p>In this section I will discuss the motivation for
                    design decisions, as well as describe the overall
                    architecture of the integrated system.</p>
                
                <subsection>

                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    
                    <p>After establishing the requirements for the
                        project we discussed the system architecture. We
                        considered a few methods of communication: one in
                        which the mobile device acts as the base station
                        for the lock, communicating with it via bluetooth
                        and passing communications over a 4G / WiFi
                        network to and from an API; another in which the
                        mobile device connected to and authenticated with
                        the lock directly.</p>

                    <p>However, we decided that these systems were too
                        insecure. In the first system the mobile device
                        could easily spoof communications from the API,
                        bypassing any authentication system in place. In
                        the second, the lock would not have a trusted
                        authority for authentication at all and would thus
                        have to trust the mobile device completely. In
                        both systems there would be no way for a user to
                        monitor the lock's status if there were no mobile
                        devices present nearby, violating the requirement
                        for users to be able to view the status of their
                        devices at all times.</p>

                    <p>We designed a third system in which the lock
                        communicates with an API directly over a WiFi or
                        mobile network. This system removed the security
                        issues present in the other two designs, as a
                        mobile device would need to authenticate with a
                        central API server and the lock would only
                        communicate with a trusted authority. Having the
                        lock repeatedly ping the server would provide
                        status updates to the API at regular intervals,
                        notifying users when their lock disappears from
                        the network (perhaps due to a power outage or
                        vandalism) and keeping information about the lock
                        up-to-date at all times.</p>

                    <div class="img-row">
                        
                        <div class="img-container outside desktop">
                            <img src="img/ayrton/communications.png" width=400 />
                            <p class="caption">The user profile page on a desktop computer.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                    </div>
                    
                    
                    <p>Communicating this information to the user is
                        where I come in. Using a central API allows us to
                        develop a suite of applications to display
                        information collected by the API. All of the
                        authentication, user and device management is
                        handled by the API, providing a uniform experience
                        across all devices and removing the need for
                        separate implementations of the same logic. All I
                        would need to do is develop a means of
                        communication between my application and the API
                        alongside <a href="michael.html">Michael</a>.</p>

                            the following API specification which would
                            provide the minimum required functionality to each

                        <p>We would also need to settle upon a method for
                            securely communicating between the API and the
                            web application. We decided to use <strong>HTTP Basic
                            Authentication</strong> to begin development,
                            which is achieved by sending the base 64
                            encoded username and password in the HTTP
                            request header. Base 64 encoding is not a
                            secure method of communcation as the process
                            is easily reversed; we settled upon this
                            authentication method not because it was
                            secure but because it was simple to implement.
                            This allowed us to focus on adding functionality
                            to the applications. In a production
                            environment we would need to change the method
                            of authentication to something more secure.</p>

                        <h3>Lock Communication</h3>

                        <p>Once the lock hardware was built we
                            discovered that our initial design for the
                            lock's communication was insufficient. The
                            lock was only able to send HTTP
                            <code>GET</code> requests to the API to
                            indicate its current status, so we needed
                            to re-think our communication design. The
                            original approach we used also prevented
                            the user from opening the lock with a
                            physical key: if the lock believed it
                            should be closed, it would continue to try
                            to close the lock even when a key was
                            used. Together with <a
                            href="jp.html">JP</a>, <a
                            href="sam.html">Sam</a>, and Michael, I
                            re-designed the logic<sup><a
                            href="#gh-lock-logic">[2]</a></sup> for
                            the lock system to use a follow-the-leader
                            approach with the lock being the
                            leader. This design caused the API to work
                            in conjunction with a physical key, making
                            <em>requests</em> for the lock to close
                            but never forcing it to do so.</p>

                        have opted for a simple design theme throughout,
                        with as little visual distraction as
                        possible. This means that my application will not
                        use flashy animations or other elements that serve
                        no functional purpose.</p>

                    <p>Opting for a simple design enables me to focus
                        on providing a fully-functional, bug-free
                        experience to the user. This will reduce
                        frustration and confusion for the user and give
                        them confidence that their device is functioning
                        as expected - if a user sees the application
                        falsely report that a lock is closed when it is in
                        fact open the product will make them feel less
                        secure.</p>

                        <h3>User Profile</h3>

                        <p>The profile page to displays the user's
                            personal information in a clear, concise
                            manner. I have opted to move the user's
                            locks to their own section of the
                            application (see the next section) to
                            avoid overloading the user with
                            information and provide quick access to
                            the specific functionality they require.</p>
                        
                        <p>The mobile image features one of the many
                            alerts the application shows to the user. In
                            the event of an error (whether caused by the
                            API or by erroneous user input) or upon
                            success of an action the user is shown a
                            message box informing them of what has just
                            occurred. This is useful for communicating
                            back-end operations to the user, clearing up
                            any concerns they may have. For example,
                            if the user attempts to register a lock but
                            the operation fails due to a database error,
                            they may ask: <em>why was my lock not
                            registered?</em> Using the message flashing
                            system we can dynamically show an error
                            message to explain why.</p>

                        <h3>Friend Overview</h3>

                        <p>The friend overview page allows a user to
                        add and remove friends. The page uses a
                        typeahead to suggest friends to users based on
                        their input - for example, if I enter
                        "<em>Mich</em>" then the typeahead might
                        suggest "<em>Mich</em>ael Inglis" as a
                        friend. This can be seen in the box
                        below. This feature is also available on
                        mobile devices.</p>

                        <p>The typeahead also suggests people you are
                        already friends with. If you select a user you
                        are already friends with, the green plus
                        button will change to a red minus, allowing

                            <p>Unlike the lock profile page, the
                                friend profile page does not allow you to
                                control access to locks you have shared
                                with other users. This feature could be
                                added to the locks under the "Your Locks"
                                section of the page to complete the
                                functionality.</p>

                            <p>This functionality was not added before
                                the submission deadline because the
                                endpoint which provides the friend profile
                                data was a last-minute addition to the
                                API. Given more time, I would add this

                            <p>To improve this display I could separate
                                the user's own locks from locks they have
                                been granted access to. This would help
                                users see the status of their own locks at
                                a glance (which they likely care more
                                about) and find what they're looking for
                                more efficiently.</p>
                            
                            <p>Taking this even further, a user could be
                                allowed to add a lock to a list of favourites
                                so that they could access frequently used
                                locks more quickly. By collecting data about
                                when a lock was opened and how often, we could
                                order the locks by most frequently or most
                                recently used.</p>

                        <p>This page displays information about a
                        user's locks. Notice the difference between
                        the mobile and desktop versions: on mobile the
                        lock button takes up most of the screen,
                        whereas on the desktop it takes up a small
                        portion.</p>

                        <p>This has been done intentionally. When
                        accessing the website on a mobile device the
                        user is most likely looking to open or close
                        their locks, so priority is given to that
                        functionality. On the desktop we have much
                        more room to display elements of the page and
                        it is more likely that a user will want to
                        manage access to their lock, so we give
                        priority to those elements. This is one of the

                            more client-side validation, for example by

                            JavaScript. This would alert the user to
                            any errors before they submit the form,
                            which would provide better ease-of-use:
                            less submissions requires less typing.</p>

                    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>

                    <p>As shown in the above sections, the application
                        uses responsive design throughout. Below are some
                        examples of the how this increases accessibility for
                        mobile users:</p>


                    <div class="img-row">
                        
                        <div class="img-container inside mobile">

                            <img src="img/ayrton/responsive-mobile.png" width=200 />
                            <p class="caption">Collapsed menu.</p>

                        <div class="img-container inside mobile">
                            <img src="img/ayrton/other-user-profile-mobile.png" width=200 />
                            <p class="caption">Resized components.</p>
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <p>Instead of being presented with the same
                        website on a mobile device with all of the
                        content scaled to an unreadable size, the
                        responsive design stacks and resizes the
                        elements to be displayed in a format more
                        suitable for mobile devices which are usually
                        portait in orientation. Compare this to the
                        Three Mobile top-up page<sup><a
                        href="#3mobile">[4]</a></sup> which does not
                        use a mobile-friendly design - ironic, given
                        that they are a company selling mobile network
                        services:</p>

                    <div class="img-row">
                        
                        <div class="img-container inside desktop-small">

                    <p>The <em>SmartLock</em> design on the right is
                        clearly more user-friendly as the text is easily
                        readable and the buttons are large enough to be
                        pressed by a human finger without misclicking.</p>

                <h1 class="page-header">Implementation</h1>

                <p>In this section I will discuss aspects of the
                    implementation, including libraries and frameworks
                    used and explanations of these choices.</p>

                <subsection>
                    
                    <h2>Web Application Framework</h2>

                    <p>I chose to use the Flask<sup><a
                        href="#flask">[5]</a></sup> web application
                        framework for this project, a lightweight web
                        application framework which is more than
                        adequate for producing applications such as
                        the <em>SmartLock</em> management interface
                        which require no database or significant
                        back-end computation.</p>

                    <p>One of the main reasons I chose this framework
                        (other than its lightweight design) is that it
                        is written in Python. When starting this
                        project I wanted to stick to a language with
                        which I was familiar. I faced a choice
                        between the Flask and Django<sup><a
                        href="#django">[6]</a></sup> frameworks. I
                        decided that Flask was more appropriate given
                        that Django is aimed at larger projects given
                        its native extensions for databases and
                        related administrative interfaces, in addition
                        to the large number of apps available to
                        extend its functionality. Whereas these
                        features may have been useful for Michael's
                        API, they would have added significant bloat
                        to my project.</p>

                    <p>The application uses Flask's session cookie
                        mechanism to keep users logged in and handle
                        session data.<p>

                </subsection>

                <subsection>

                    <h2>Communication with the API</h2>

                    <p>The application makes heavy use of the
                        <code>requests</code> library<sup><a
                        href="#python-requests">[7]</a></sup> to
                        communicate with Michael's API. The library
                        makes it very simple to create and process
                        HTTP requests.</p>

                    <p>Since the back-end handled authentication and
                        session data, I created local endpoints which
                        forwarded requests to the API. This allowed me
                        to make AJAX calls to the API from the
                        JavaScript code without implementing separate
                        JavaScript authentication, keeping all of the
                        communication functionality in one place and
                        ensuring that changes in communication
                        (e.g. an update to token authentication) would
                        be reflected in all areas of the code.</p>

                </subsection>

                <subsection>

                    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>

                    <p>To make the application's design responsive, I
                        took a mobile-first approach using the
                        Bootstrap<sup><a
                        href="#bootstrap">[8]</a></sup>
                        framework. Bootstrap is a style framework
                        which allows developers to create sites using
                        a grid system which rearrange content
                        depending on the size and orientation of the
                        user's screen.</p>

                    <p>Bootstrap is in such wide use that it could
                        almost be considered a web standard. By using
                        Bootstrap I have made it much easier for other
                        developers to understand and access my code, as
                        the majority of web developers will have at least
                        a passing familiarity with the code. In addition,
                        Bootstrap's functionality is well documented,
                        making it easy for even the novice developer to
                        dive in at the deep end. The alternative would be
                        to use a lesser-known framework or roll my own CSS
                        from scratch, which besides being extremely time
                        consuming would also make it more challenging for
                        someone else to re-use my code without extensive
                        documentation.</p>

                </subsection>

                <subsection>

                    <h2>Client-side Functionality</h2>
                    
                    <p>The application relies on clientside
                        functionality to perform some actions. For
                        example when the user clicks the lock button,
                        an AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
                        request is made to the API in order to open
                        the lock. This creates a more seamless
                        end-user experience by removing the need for a
                        page reload to update the content; the button
                        changes its status live on-screen depending
                        upon the status of the lock.</p>

                    <p>The jQuery library<sup><a
                        href="#jquery">[9]</a></sup> was used to
                        perform AJAX requests and update page
                        content. jQuery abstracts away a lot of
                        JavaScript's notoriously verbose and
                        unintuitive syntax. Compare the code for an
                        AJAX request between native JavaScript and the
                        jQuery library:</p>

                    <pre><code>function loadDoc() {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (xhttp.readyState == 4 && xhttp.status == 200) {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
  }
};</code></pre>
                    <p><em>XMLHttPRequest example from W3Schools<sup><a href="#w3xhr">[10]</a></sup></em></p>

                    <pre><code>$.ajax({
  url: "test.html",
  context: document.body
}).done(function() {
  $( this ).addClass( "done" );
});</pre></code>
                    <p><em>jQuery <code>.ajax()</code> example from the library's documentation<sup><a href="#jquery-ajax">[11]</a></sup></em></p>

                    <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> native code
                    performs very similar functionality to the jQuery
                    code. However, the jQuery example is much more
                    readable: "make a request to
                    <code>test.html</code>. Once the request is done,
                    change the CSS class of this element" compared to
                    "make a new XMLHttpRequest object, then when the
                    ready state changes check if the ready state is 4
                    and the status is 200, then set the HTML of the
                    <code>demo</code> element to the response text".</p>
                    
                    <p>This library was chosen for similar reasons as
                        Bootstrap: its wide use and promotion of clean
                        code allows the majority of developers to jump
                        right in and begin coding without needing to
                        study the library's documentation.</p>

                    <h2>Typeahead Search</h2>

                    <p>The typeahead functionality is provided by
                        Twitter's <code>typeahead.js</code><sup><a
                        href="#typeahead">[12]</a></sup>.  This library
                        was chosen because of its robustness and the
                        extreme ease with which typeahead search can
                        be implemented. The library can produce a
                        typeahead from JSON data with almost any
                        structure provided that the developer configures
                        it correctly.</p>

                    <p>I created a new API endpoint<sup><a
                        href="#friendpoint">[13]</a></sup> in my web
                        application which transforms the API data into
                        a format suitable for creating a
                        typeahead. Given more time I would integrate
                        this endpoint into the API and remove it from
                        my code, but for now this method is
                        acceptable.</p>

                    <h2>Cloud Hosting</h2>

                    <p>The management application uses the free tier
                        of the Heroku hosting platform-as-a-service
                        (PaaS). The application has been configured
                        specifically for deployment to Heroku,
                        although other options are available.</p>

                    <p>The application is available live at <a
                        href="http://slip-d-web.herokuapp.com/">slip-d-web.herokuapp.com</a>,
                        using a copy of the API with my additions
                        (which is hosted at <a
                        href="http://slip-d-api.herokuapp.com/">slip-d-api.herokuapp.com</a>). <em>Note:
                        The application may run slowly on Heroku since
                        it is hosted on the free tier. The free tier
                        forces applications to "sleep" for at least 6
                        hours per day and after 30 minutes of
                        receiving no requests, causing performance
                        issues. This can be easily rectified by
                        upgrading the platform to the paid version -
                        however, the free tier is fine for
                        demonstration.</em></p>

                    <p>If you would like to try out the web
                    application, you can register with the site by
                    following the link above. You need to obtain a
                    copy of the <a

                    variable to the following value:</p>
                        
                    <pre><code>API_BASE_ADDR="http://slip-d-api.herokuapp.com/"</code></pre>

                    <p>You can then run the script from a terminal in the following way:</p>

                    <pre><code>$ python fakelock.py $LOCK_ID</code></pre>

                    <p>Where <code>$LOCK_ID</code> is the ID of the
                    lock you want to emulate, for example,
                    <code>1234</code>. You must have the
                    <code>requests</code> library installed to use
                    this script which can be installed by
                    running:</p>
                    
                    <pre><code>$ pip install requests</code></pre>

                    <h2>API Contribution</h2>

                    <p>I contributed a couple of features to the
                    API. As discussed in the design section, I helped
                    design and subsequently implemented<sup><a
                    href="gh-lock-logic">[2]</a></sup> the lock
                        communication logic.</p>

                    <p>After the group presentations I implemented new
                        functionality in the <code>friends</code> and
                        <code>users</code> endpoints to help finish my
                        application; namely, the data provided about
                        access granted to devices to and from other
                        users. This allowed me to create the friend
                        profile page and display which locks a
                        particular user has been granted access to or
                        has shared with you. This information was
                        previously available on the lock endpoint but
                        not alongside the user data.</p>

                <subsection>

                    <h2>Device Emulator</h2>

                    <p>In order to test the functionality of the apps
                        before the hardware lock had been created, I
                        implemented a device emulator script<sup><a
                        href="#gh-lock-emulator">[1]</a></sup> in
                        Python. This script uses the
                        <code>requests</code> library to simulate
                        communications to and from a
                        <em>SmartLock</em> device.</p>

                    <p>This script allowed each of the developers to
                        work on their applications
                        independently. Since we only have one physical
                        lock, we would not have been able to work on
                        our applications at the same time without
                        it. The script was essential to the
                        development of the entire team's projects, and
                        also helped us debug the communications with
                        the physical lock: myself and JP worked
                        together to determine why the lock was
                        initially unable to connect to the API. With
                        the help of the code I had written to emulate
                        the device we were able to determine the source
                        of the problem and recitfy it.</p>

                    <h2>Design for Reuse</h2>

                    <p>The web application was designed with code
                        reuse in mind. As discussed previously, I
                        chose to use libraries and frameworks which
                        were in wide use to allow new developers to
                        better understand my source code without
                        having to send significant amounts of time
                        reading the documentation. Sticking to widely
                        used frameworks also makes my application more
                        robust; since the projects are contributed to
                        by many software engineers security
                        vulnerabilities and bugs will be patched very
                        quickly.</p>

                    <p>I have taken great care to promote code reuse
                        wherever possible. All of the API requests go
                        through the same function which crafts a
                        request from its parameters - by abstracting
                        commonly used functionality in this way, to
                        its own function or class, I am able to modify
                        all uses of that code in the same place, and
                        prevent security issues or bugs which arise
                        from multiple <em>slightly varied</em>
                        instances of the same code (a common
                        side-effect of copy-pasting).</p>

                    <p>Not only that, but I can take the demonstration
                        of my code reuse one step further: my own
                        personal website<sup><a
                        href="#portfolio">[14]</a></sup> shares some
                        of its codebase with the management
                        application. The basic Flask setup (including
                        the WSGI configuration for running the server
                        process) has proven very valuable in
                        configuring my own site. My portfolio is
                        hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS, proving that
                        while the management application is configured
                        for Heroku it can easily be deployed to
                        another service.</p>

                    <h2>Critical Evaluation of Work</h2>

                    <p>When discussing the project we initially identified the following requirements:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide a means to <strong>register devices</strong> to a user</li>
                        <li>Allow users to <strong>operate</strong> their registered devices remotely</li>
                        <li>Display the <strong>status</strong> of their registered devices at all times</li>
                        <li>Provide <strong>shared access controls</strong></li>
                        <li>Allow <strong>secure communication</strong> between the user and their device</li>
                        <li>Display correctly across a <strong>range of mobile and desktop platforms</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I believe that our application meets most of
                        the identified requirements. We have provided all
                        the required functionality: the ability to manage
                        and control devices, share access with friends and
                        keep the user informed of the status of the
                        device.</p>

                    <p>I took a mobile-first approach using responsive
                        design techniques in order to make the application
                        truly cross-platform.</p>

                    <p>The only requirement I feel I could have
                        improved was the security aspect, which I will
                        discuss below.</p>

                    <subsection>

                        <h3>Highlights</h3>

                        <p>Some aspects of the project I am especially
                            proud of and would like to draw attention
                            to.</p>

                        <p>Firstly, the robustness of the
                            application. I have extensively
                            user-tested my application and have found
                            that in the majority of cases the
                            application functions as expected. When an
                            unavoidable issue occurs (e.g. when the
                            API is unavailable due to the limitation
                            on free Heroku apps) descriptive error
                            messages inform the user of the cause of
                            the issue and encourage them to try again
                            at a later time.</p>

                        <p>Second, the effort put in to targeting
                            mobile devices. Due to the way the pages
                            re-arrange themselves (which required a
                            moderate amount of custom extensions for
                            the lock detail page button) our system
                            can truly claim to be cross-platform. We
                            are now able to function upon any device
                            with an internet connection with the same
                            quality as a native application.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the effort which was expended to
                            integrate various libraries with the
                            design of the application. The default
                            typeahead search does not provide any
                            built-in style formatting, so I modified
                            some Bootstrap-targeted CSS to add custom
                            buttons to the form field and JavaScript
                            to update the buttons' status depending on

                        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>

                        <p>Although I feel that I excelled in some
                        areas, I recognise that I could have made some
                        improvements to my work which I will discuss
                        further below.</p>

                        <subsection>
                            
                            <h4>Documentation</h4>
                                
                                <p>The documentation of the code for
                                    this project is slim to
                                    none. Although I have tried my
                                    best to write code which is as
                                    clean and readable as possible, I
                                    have failed to document much of
                                    the code's functionality. One of
                                    my biggest weaknesses is lack of
                                    documentation of code - often
                                    hampering my ability to understand
                                    my own code. Many developers fall
                                    in to the trap of believing their
                                    code is <em>self-describing</em>
                                    but fail to see that they have not
                                    done any
                                    <em>actual-describing</em>. When
                                    coding to tight deadlines it is
                                    often tempting to skimp on
                                    documentation. If I were to make
                                    one change to the way I completed
                                    this project, it would be to
                                    better describe the functionality
                                    and thought process that went into
                                    development, and is certainly
                                    something I will put more focus on
                                    in future projects.</p>

                                <h4>Co-ordination</h4>

                                <p>When developing the application we
                                    sometimes found it difficult to
                                    co-ordinate our efforts. For example,
                                    I might be working on one feature
                                    while Michael works on something
                                    else. Because we mostly kept to our
                                    own sections of the project it became
                                    difficult to understand and make
                                    changes to each others' work, so if I
                                    required a feature from the API I
                                    would have to wait for Michael to
                                    implement it before I could continue.</p>

                                <p>Due to the delays in the
                                    construction of the lock (which was no
                                    fault on the part of the team -
                                    unfortunately, the Prospeckz board and
                                    some of the lock hardware were
                                    arriving as late as <em>7 weeks</em> in to the
                                    project) we struggled to properly
                                    design the communication between the
                                    hardware and software. The software
                                    team were unaware that the board was
                                    only able to make HTTP
                                    <code>GET</code> requests over GPRS,
                                    which meant we had to re-design the
                                    code to fit this new system at a very
                                    late stage.</p>

                                <p>However, in some areas we excelled
                                    at communication. Much of the
                                    development went without a hitch and
                                    team members were more than willing to
                                    contribute to any area of the project
                                    they could - although everyone had
                                    their own area of development, we
                                    often crossed paths and wrote code for
                                    each other to help produce a fully
                                    integrated system. I can say that
                                    without a doubt this was the most
                                    enjoyable group project I have
                                    participated in, which is wholly due
                                    to the positive attitude and work
                                    ethic of the rest of the team.</p>

                        <subsection>

                            <h4>Security</h4>

                            <p>Although we discussed security at
                                length (see <a href="dan.html">Dan</a>'s
                                report), we elected to focus on
                                functionality over security throughout
                                development of this project. I think that
                                we certainly could have improved in this
                                respect - and if I were to continue this
                                project, it would be a priority - as the
                                very nature of a lock requires it to be
                                secure.</p>

                            <p>The way we implemented security between
                                the API and my application was extremely
                                insecure: the base 64 encoding of
                                sensitive data is incredibly easy to
                                reverse and not a method of
                                encryption. Sensitive information such as
                                e-mail addresses are displayed on the
                                pages of all users, regardless of whether
                                they are a trusted friend.</p>

                            <p>In a real system we would have to be
                                much more careful to secure sensitive
                                data. We would need to secure all
                                information sent between the user, the
                                application and the API using SSL
                                encryption. We would also need to set
                                access controls to sensitive data,
                                avoiding giving out information such as
                                e-mail addresses to people without the
                                proper authorization.</p>

                            <p>However, I personally feel that the aim
                                of the project was to produce a proof of
                                concept and not a production system. Many
                                of the choices we made were influenced by
                                the limited time and resources we had
                                available (for example, the changes to the
                                lock hardware from an over-the-lock device
                                to a custom-built lock, or the fact that
                                an SSL certificate costs upwards of £30
                                and I don't have that kind of money to
                                spend). In some areas we provided basic
                                security: the session data is all
                                encrypted using a secret key only known to
                                the application, and adding at least basic
                                username/password authentication prevents
                                users from simply accessing all the data
                                with no barrier at all.</p>

                        <h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>

                        <p>Through pure effort and great teamwork we
                            successfully produced a proof-of-concept
                            of a fully integrated system, and in my
                            opinion through this we achieved the true
                            goal of the project. Thanks to the robust
                            design and implementation of the
                            application, using many modern web and
                            design standards, I have produced a truly
                            reusable and versatile application which
                            is a testament to the quality of the
                            team's work.  If you'd like to check out
