                <p> When creating the SmartLock our vision was to design and
                create a lock which could be controlled remotely, using a
                smartphone. Our SmartLock would be built with the ability to
                transmit data and communicate its state to a web server, thus
                commanding the physical lock of door to open remotely. </p>

                <p> I contributed considerably to the success of this task. My
                main contribution was the design and implementation of the iOS
                application, the element which ultimately controlled by the
                lock, via the API. I also worked extensively on both the design
                and implementation of the API, collaboration closely with
                Michael to ensure it was extensive enough for the feature set I
                wanted to implement within the iOS Application and to give us a
                strong integration, fully utilising every aspect of the API.
                </p>

                <p> I designed and structure the oral and visual presentation
                which the team gave earlier in the semester. To efficiently
                incorporate the aspects of the system that the team wanted to
                describe in the presentation, I opened the content up in a
                google slide collaboration document. On the day of the
                presentation I was also the main speaker. </p>

                <p> The server would handle all the traffic between the lock and
                the server; providing an API to register users, open locks and
                grant access to friends in order to open the locks.
                </p>

                <p> Nowadays we consider a smartphone a very common device and
                therefore it seemed a logical choice of front end. We decided to
                implement the front end on the two main operating systems, iOS
                and Android. Furthermore, since we had the skill set and
                resources available we also implemented an admin interface on a
                web app. </p>

                <p> In this report I will further detail and explain my work
                load.  </p>

            <h1 class="page-header">Behaviour Driven Development</h1>

            <subsection class="col-md-12">

                <p> I chose to do Behaviour driven development from the outset
                of the project, so the collaborative code that we developed as a
                team always had the behaviour that we intended. The people who
                benefit most from software testing are the people who are
                further adding to the lines of code and therefore instead of
                waiting till the end of the project to write the tests we
                developed them simultaneously to the application code. </p>


                <ol>
                    <li>Write a test</li>
                    <li>Run all of the tests, making sure that the new test fails</li>
                    <li>Write the minimal code that will make the test pass</li>
                    <li>Make sure that all of the previous tests still pass</li>
                    <li>Refactor your code</li>
                </ol>

                <p> Behaviour driven development provides a scaffold for when
                one is unsure about how to implement something. It allows you to
                have a conversation with the code, asking it questions, getting
                answers and then adjusting. This makes it a great exploratory
                tool for understanding something new. It also makes our system
                more maintainable, flexible and easily extensible; since at the
                most granular level, it is guaranteed that every standalone
                piece of logic can be tested and therefore changed confidently.
                </p>

                <p> The benefits of Behaviour driven development are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced number of lines of code</li>
                        <li>Prevents breaking of old code (regressions)</li>
                        <li>Better APIs since the API naturally written from an user’s perspective</li>
                        <li>Refactoring Encourages Improvements therefore the codebase does not grow unless it needs to</li>
                        <li>Provides executable documentation which is a series of example on how the code works</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 class="page-header">A System Level View</h2>

                <p> The API is the central hub of the SmartLock system,
                therefore it is vital that the reliability of the API remains
                very high. The API maintains a database which records
                information about the locks and users. Additionally the lock
                interface corresponds with the API to record the locks current
                state, being either locked or unlocked. The applications allow
                the user to manage their locks, friends and lock permissions.
                </p>

                <p> When the apps send a request to open a lock, the API updates
                the database. When the lock next communicates with the API, the
                API will tell it to open.  </p>

            <h1 class="page-header">Flask Web API</h1>

            <subsection class="col-md-12">

                <p> When I designed the API, I had several frameworks to choose
                from, in many languages. In the end, I chose Flask. The decision
                to adopt Flask was primarily based on the opinion that we felt
                it best suited the style of development I wanted to use
                throughout the project, enabling us to prototype the system and
                iteratively improve it. </p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection class="col-md-12">

                <h2 class="page-header">Code Structure and API Endpoints</h2>

                <p> The code structure follows the MVC design pattern, which
                separates the data models such as Users and Locks from the
                controller. The traditional notion of a view was replaced with
                JSON serializers which would transform the given data into JSON.
                </p>

                <p> At the early stages I decided to standardise our endpoints
                across the system so that using the API would be as intuitive as
                possible. This is an example of the self generating
                documentation… </p>

                <br>

                <div align="middle">
                    <img src="img/sam/api.png" width=800 height=650 style="text-align: center" />
                </div>

                <br>

                <p> When executing complex queries we wanted to keep the code at
                the ORM level that SQLAlchemy provides but without compromising
                on the efficiency that offloading complex queries to the
                database could offer. I spent a vast amount of time optimising
                the SQLAlchemy code on the API such that this could be achieved.
                This meant that the response time to the iOS Application and the
                physical lock was as short as possible. </p>

                <p> The Cyclic Dependencies in python gave us some problems with
                the boilerplate code when beginning the project. By moving the
                files into a logical order I was able to overcome this problem
                in the application code base as well as offering a uniform API
                for the unit tests to use so that the cyclic dependencies did
                not surface again.
                </p>

                <p> Ayrton, Michael, JP and myself spent a considerable amount
                of time designing the part of the API which interfaced with the
                Lock itself. I came up with a ‘follow the leader’ protocol which
                makes the lock follow the state of the lock on the server which
                Ayrton and I implemented in the flask API. I then went onto
                design a use case which would simulate every possible scenario
                for this protocol and create automated unit tests to ensure that
                this important behavior remained the same. I think this was
                imperative to enable our system to reach maximum efficiency; the
                protocol is further explained in Aytrons report, here.
                </p>

                <p> The friends endpoint required very specific behavior on the
                API so that we could utilise it properly in the front end web
                application and the mobile applications. We needed it to have a
                nested structure which lists user who the currently logged in
                user was friends with. Subsequently for each user, it listed the
                locks which the the currently logged in user owns and which of
                those this friend had access to.  I implemented a complex
                database query and the accompanying automated tests to perform
                this query efficiently. </p>

                <p> As the API scaled, there became a need for more standardised
                class names and endpoints. I devised a simple naming scheme for
                both the classes of API, requiring them to adhere to either
                “ClassDetail” or “ClassList”, where “Class” is the name of the
                class obviously and the methods in the “Detail” classes return
                the detail of a singular instance of that class and “list”
                returning multiple instances of that class as well as creating
                new instance.  </p>

                <h2 class="page-header">API Security</h2>

                <p> I want the system to be created initially as a minimum
                viable product which could be iteratively improved in the
                future. The authentication protocol that I chose to implement
                between the application and the server was <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP
                basic auth</a>. </p>

                <div class="img-row">

                    <div class="img-container outside desktop">
                        <img src="img/sam/basicauth.gif" width=400 />
                        <p class="caption">HTTP Basic Auth Protocol</p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p> Basic auth is not inherently a secure protocol since it
                involves sending the username and password with every request.
                An attacker can gain access to a user's account buy simply
                intercepting the transmutation of the request. However by
                attaching the authentication in the header of the request and
                sending it over HTTPS using the ssl encryption, the
                authentication details now become encrypted and the protocol has
                a reasonable level of security. This method is reasonably simple
                to implement and offers the level of security that we required
                for this project. </p>

                <div class="img-row">

                    <div class="img-container outside desktop">
                        <img src="img/sam/oauth.png" width=300 />
                        <p class="caption">OAuth Protocol</p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p> If we were to move the project into production we would use
                the more secure <a href="http://oauth.net/2/">OAuth protocol</a> which involves passing tokens with
                the request instead of the user's password and email. This means
                that even if a request was intercepted and decrypted, the attack
                would only gain access to the users account for a limited time.
                We have allowed this implementation to be inserted into both the
                API and the iOS application by abstracting away the network
                level security protocols from the rest of the application code.
                This means the if we needed a greater level of security in the
                future then it could be implemented with minimal cost. </p>

                <h2 class="page-header">Automated Testing</h2>

                <p> The Flask Web server is the centre of the entire system, it
                is therefore imperative that it is as reliable as possible.
                Ultimately, if the server fails then all the other components in
                the system will stop working.  </p>

                <p> Since collaboration commonly occurs in the Python code on
                the server,  having accompanying tests provided protection for
                the API for every push of code. Integration tests were also used
                to test the endpoints of the server, to ensure that they have
                the desired behaviour and do not have any undesired side
                effects. </p>

                <p> While the unit tests produced can serve to protect from
                regressions, they are not sufficient on their own to assess and
                ensure quality. Integration tests that combine several units
                together are essential to establish a complete picture of
                quality. As new API endpoints were added to the project we
                needed to test them to make sure that they performed the logic
                that we expected and the they did not have any undesired side
                effects. </p>

                <p> Acceptance were also required to evaluate system from the
                user interface on the app to the API on the server and through
                to the lock. We used only a mock version of the application and
                created acceptance tests in a few specific use cases to ensure
                that the system as a whole has the required behaviour. </p>

                <p> The Flask framework which was chosen at the start of the
                project is a good framework, however we should have used the
                more mature framework called Django. Django offer a better
                integrated ORM (Object Relational Mapper) than the ORM called
                SQLAlchemy which we used. It also offers ‘out of the box’ user
                models along with authentication which we reduce the amount of
                time we have spent developing this in our own API and would also
                produce a more secure and more modular solution. Django also has
                a superior REST framework which is the most advanced and mature
                of its kind called Django Rest Framework.</p>

                <p> To increase the level of security that our application
                offers we should have used Facebook authentication. This is
                based on the OAuth protocol which was discussed in the security
                section and would have provided a more secure way of
                authenticating the iOS app with our API. </p>

                <h2 class="page-header">Design</h2>

                <p> The iOS application has been designed for home users where
                we assume that they will have a small number of locks and a
                large number of friends.</p>

                <h3>Application Logo</h3>

                <p> I designed the logo of my app, which came to represent the
                entire project. The logo encompasses a brain and a lock in an
                effort to visually represent the name of the project, SmartLock.
                Upon pressing the app icon, individuals are brought to a screen
                which has username and password text fields along with “login”
                and “register” buttons.  </p>

                <div class="img-row">

                    <div class="img-container outside desktop">
                        <img src="img/sam/SmartLockLogo.png" width=300 />
                    </div>

                </div>

                <h3>Core Application UI Design </h3>

                <p> The colour scheme and styles established on the register
                page introduces the user to the consistent theme which they will
                experience throughout app. I implemented a dark gray bar which
                is consistently at the top and bottom of each page of the app
                and is offset by a lighter gray which acts as whitespace. This
                focuses the user’s eye onto what is displayed over this on
                screen and reduces clutter, allowing individuals to understand
                exactly what they should be doing on this specific screen.  </p>

                <div class="img-row">

                    <div class="img-container outside desktop">
                        <img src="img/sam/app1.png" width=200 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>

                    <div class="img-container outside desktop">
                        <img src="img/sam/app2.png" width=200 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p> White boxes are used as text fields against this lighter
                gray background, the contrast in tone not only allows them to
                stand out, but is also the standard format for text input. I
                relied on the user’s previous knowledge to determine what these
                are. The boxes contain text which alludes to what the boxes are,
                which avoids any possible confusion as to which text field is
                which and is a far cleaner method of design than having the text
                outside next to the box. The text is also 50% opacity in an
                effort to better distinguish it from inputted text which is 0%
                opacity.  </p>

                <p> The buttons were a bright orange colour which contrasts the
                dark gray and allows them to stand out as clickable interfaces.
                This harsh colour contrast was picked over having beveled
                looking edges for a consistent flat design. The user may here
                enter in the email and password they want and press “login” to
                login or “register” which reveals more fields required to create
                an account. Once the user has added the relevant information and
                clicked on one of the respective buttons, a throbber is
                displayed to give feedback that the application is reacting to
                the user’s response. </p>

                <h3>User & Lock List UI Design</h3>

                <p> This allows us to display on the each lock full screen and
                show a summary of the member in each lock. We have also
                displayed the open button in a contrasting colour so the user
                intuitively knows what to press to open the door. </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <br>
                    <div class="col-xs-4" >
                        <img src="img/sam/app3.png" height=400 width=220 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-xs-4">
                        <img src="img/sam/app4.png" height=400 width=220 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-xs-4">
                        <img src="img/sam/app5.png" height=400 width=220 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br><br>

                <p> The design of the lists is the same for users and locks.
                This is not only helpful for the user, but from a developer
                standpoint too; I only had to implement it once and as a module,
                reuse it later. The list view uses a white background with rows
                separated with by a line. Sufficient padding was added to
                increase white space and avoid clutter. Two lines of text can be
                seen for each row, Name and Email for user lists and Name and
                Owner Email for locks. This information is displayed with the
                first line in bold and a larger text size, adding emphasis to
                the main content of the row and allowing for more efficient
                scrolling. The common UI action of allowing the list to be
                pulled down or up beyond its content was also implemented. This
                gives the list a more natural scrolling feel as opposed to a
                static list which ended at the top and bottom.  </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <br>
                    <div class="col-xs-4" >
                        <img src="img/sam/app6.png" height=400 width=220 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-xs-4">
                        <img src="img/sam/app7.png" height=400 width=220 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-xs-4">
                        <img src="img/sam/app8.png" height=400 width=220 class="dropshadow"/>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <br><br>

                <p> This consistency of structure and colour scheme re enforces
                the user to know they are in the same app, allowing them to
                reuse any interactions they previously used in sections of the
                application they haven’t been in. From a
                human-computer-interaction standpoint, this allows them to speed
                up their learning and understanding of how to use the
                application, something which reduces their frustration increases
                their overall enjoyment. </p>

                <h2 class="page-header">Code Structure</h2>

                <p> The iOS application design plan was formulated following an
                augmented MVC design pattern, utilising five layers over the
                traditional three. By separating the modules of the application
                code into this structure I was able to keep the modules more
                maintainable, extensible and more easily write unit tests for
                it.</p>

                <h4>Network Layer</h4>

                <p> The lowest level layer was the Network layer. It comprises
                of the functions which call and receive from the API, converting
                the command received from the Model Layer into a request before
                attaching the authorisation headers. It also handles the
                authentication which was discussed in the security section. </p>

                <p> The Network layer waits for as long as the timeout permits,
                hopefully receiving a response from the API. If the response is
                received, the layer decodes the result into JSON, passing it to
                the Model Layer. </p>

                <h4>Model Layer</h4>

                <p> The Model layer supplies the url of the data it wishes to
                receive to the Network Layer. Once the Network layer has
                returned the expected data, this layer takes the received raw
                JSON and converts it to one of the objects seen above so it can
                be easily accessed throughout the project, increasing
                readability as it allows us only to deal with one programming
                language. </p>

                <h4>View-Model Layer</h4>

                <p> The View-Model layer holds collections of models and
                performs the ‘business logic’ of the application, requesting
                models from the model layer and sending data to the view
                controller. </p>

                <h4>View-Controller</h4>

                <p> The Model-View layer responds to commands by the user by
                registering finger-swipes and button presses. It then asks the
                view-model for the correct logic to perform. It also updates the
                UI based of the data that it recieves from the layer above.</p>

                <h4>View</h4>

                <p>This is a static layer which is used to customise the
                presentation and the layout of user interface and generally how
                to display data. It is assigned a view-controller which has
                ownership over the view, telling it what to display. </p>

            <subsection class="col-md-12">

                <h2 class="page-header">iOS Application Security</h2>

                <p> The network layer implements the HTTP Basic which the API is
                using to authenticate the user. The application stores the
                username and password securely in iOS keychain, which is the
                most secure way of storing user credentials in iOS. I have also
                allowed to the authorisation method to be swapped in the iOS
                application if the OAuth authentication or facebook
                authentication is implemented in the future. </p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection class="col-md-12">

                <h2 class="page-header">Automated Testing</h2>

                <p> I have performed behavioral driven development in the same
                way as the API, meaning that the tests for the iOS application
                were developed at the same time as the code, bringing all the
                benefits discussed in the testing section. I have also
                implemented UI tests which run all of the use cases as a series
                of simulated user actions. This ensures that the quality of the
                user interaction in the final product is high and that it will
                always remain high as long as  behavioral driven development is
                used when developing the application in the future.</p>

                <h2 class="page-header">Evaluation</h2>

                <p>Features that could be added to the iOS application to
                improve the user experience are the QR scanner and push
                notification. The QR scanner will read in the lock ID
                automatically so that the user no longer has to type in the
                identification code of their locks when they are looking to
                register them to an account. The push notifications will alert
                the owner when there has been a malicious entry, however this
                machine learning task was never implemented on the API. There
                are limited useful situations where push notification could be
                used if the automatic fraud detection is not implemented. For
                this reason I did not add push notifications to the application
                but thanks to the modular design of the code, this could be
                added with minimal time and effort.</p>

                <p> I have implemented the basic features of the system, making
                them reasonably reliable and designing the code to be highly
                modular and scaleable for future development. However the
                security of the whole system still needs to be evaluated to
                ensure that it meets the level we set out at the start of the
                project. </p>

                <p> The presentation involved bring together all the different
                components of the project so that the system could be presented
                as one uniform entity. To do this I separated out the
                presentation into equal portions section where the person on the
                team with the most expertise would be the main speaker for that
                section. </p>

                <p> We also developed a demo of the system as a whole to
                showcase every aspect of the system in a succinct but detailed
                part of the presentation. The video recording backup was created
                as a team and michael did a good job of editing it the final cut
                with audio and visual effects. By introducing the presentation,
                describing the iOS application, speaking during the demo and
                concluding the presentation I believe that I was the main
                presenter on the day. </p>
